# adresboek 1907

Map plotting the Amsterdam 1907 Addressbook, see [addressbooks.amsterdamtimemachine.nl/](https://addressbooks.amsterdamtimemachine.nl/). Same code could of course be used for other years. 

## Data

The map uses partly cleaned and aligned ocr-text, so the data shown is not complete. Please consider the map as a tool visualising the current state of the data. More on the data and the data itself on [CREATE GitLab](https://gitlab.com/uvacreate/amsterdam-time-machine/amsterdam-address-books).

To download the geojson of your search click the first 'x addresses', to get an html-table of the addresses that could not be shown on the map click the second 'x addresses'. Reminder: there might be other entries not yet linked to your search parameter, and thus not present in either geojson or html-table.

## Legend

Clicking a dot on the map shows the entries in the legend. The colors of the entries indicate the part of the addressbook (by profession, by street, alphabetical, student corps) the entry was found in.

A click on the entry itself will open the scan at the City Archives site the entry was found on.

## Maplayers

From zoomlevel 15 onwards, the Stamen backgroundmap is replaced with the [1909 Publieke Werken map](https://tiles.amsterdamtimemachine.nl/).

Press [space] to hide the 1909 map and show the openstreetmap layer (with current addresses and markers for shops, restaurants, etc. - sometimes a 1905 'slijter' is still a bar today).
